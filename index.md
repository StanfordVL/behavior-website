<!-- #### What is BEHAVIOR? -->

BEHAVIOR is a simulation benchmark to evaluate Embodied AI solutions. Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) is advancing. But where are we now? We propose to test EAI agents with the physical challenges humans solve in their everyday life: household activities such as doing laundry, picking up toys, setting the table, or cleaning floors. BEHAVIOR is a benchmark in simulation where EAI agents need to plan and execute navigation and manipulation strategies based on sensor information to fulfill 1,000 household activities.

BEHAVIOR tests the ability of agents to perceive the environment, plan, and execute complex long-horizon activities that involve multiple objects, rooms, and state changes, all with the reproducibility, safety and observability offered by a realistic physics simulation. To compare the performance of EAI agents to that of humans, we have collected human demonstrations in the same tasks and environments using virtual reality. The demonstrations serve as reference to compare EAI solutions, but they also be used to develop them.
